## The Objective of the HR Dashboard | Business Problem |Business Requirement

Before diving into data, it’s crucial to align with your organization’s HR goals. Identify the specific questions your dashboard aims to answer. What insights are HR professionals seeking to understand employee attrition?

- HR KPIs: Analyze employee count, average salary, average monthly salary, average age, average salary hike, average Job satisfaction score, and gender ratio.
- Identify trends and patterns in employee data across different parameters like Education, Age group, and Department.
- Analyze different HR KPIs for different Job roles.
- Show the impact of Age & Department on Salary.
- Employee Attrition Analysis: Identify the factors that influence employee turnover and retention, such as salary, age, gender, education, and employee demographics (e.g., age, marital status, work-life balance).
